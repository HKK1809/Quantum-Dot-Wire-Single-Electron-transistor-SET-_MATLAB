This lab focuses on multiple concepts of quantum mechanics, the first one being discussed in section 2.0 is the atomic spectrum observed in single electron atoms. This lab focuses on the hydrogen atom and the single ionized Helium atom. Section 2 discussed the generalized for of the wavelength formulae for the hydrogen atom and ionized Helium atom on electron transition from one energy level to another, along with the energy level formula for ionized helium atom. Lastly section2, uses MATLAB to find what energy level transition provide wavelength in visible region in ionized Helium atom. Section 3 discusses the heterojunction behavior between AlxGa1-xAs/GaAs the band gap values are analyzed for provided specifications along with band bending behavior with formation of 2DEG. Next, section 4 dives deeper into application of heterojunctions with analysis if a InAS | GaAs | InAs | GaA
